# Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet


![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)


The United States Geological Survey(USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. They hope to be able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

In this challenge, a new set of tools is developed that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data in a more indepth and interactive way to create better user experience.

The tasks are as follows:


Level 1: Basic Visualization

The first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.

-Get your data set

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats at (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and a data set was picked to visualize. 

-Import & Visualize the Data

   A map is created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

   * Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * A legend is created that provides context for the map data.
